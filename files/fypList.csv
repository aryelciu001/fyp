1,A S Madhukumar,asmadhukumar@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0448,,Design and development of an end-to-end communication system using deep neural networks,"The design and implementation of conventional communication systems are built upon strong probabilistic models and assumptions.  Such communication system design has limited flexibility when designing applications for newer generation wireless systems with high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, deep learning has shown a high potential to address this challenge via data-driven solution and thereby improving the utilization of limited wireless spectrum resources.  Instead of following a rigid design, new generations of wireless system empowered by cognitive radio can learn from spectrum data, and optimize their spectrum utilization to enhance their performance.  In this context, the present project will investigate how deep learning can be used to design and end-to-end communication system using an enoder to replace the transmitter functionalities such as modulation and coding, and a decoder for the receiver functionalities such as demodulation and decoding. The project uses an auto encoder to improve the performance of conventional systems by jointly optimizing the communication between the transmitter and receiver, instead of optimizing the individual modules.  The proposed deep learning based encoder-decoder design captures channel impairments and optimises the transmitter and receiver operations jointly for a single-antenna system."
2,A S Madhukumar,asmadhukumar@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0451,,Autoencoder based optical wireless communication systems,"Optical wireless communications (OWC) is a promising technique for supporting high data rate communications as a complementary or backup technology to radio frequency communications. One of the most popular communication technique in OWC is the intensity modulation using laser diode and direct detection technique with a photodetector.  Studying the communication performance of this simple system is rather difficult due to the challenges in structured signal-space model that can capture all the physical restrictions in the optical channels.  Therefore, we need alternative methods for system analysis which does not heavily depending on existing channel models and it leads to learning based schemes based on deep neural networks.  Among these schemes, autoencoders are of special interest as they can capture the end-to-end performance of the entire communication system building blocks in transmission and reception.  In this context, this project investigates innovative methods for single and multi-user OWC scenarios based on autoencoders.  Under this project, the student has to build, train and run a complete OWC system solely composed of deep neural networks and compare the end-to-end performance of our proposed autoencoders with the model based optical communication systems."
3,A S Madhukumar,asmadhukumar@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0455,,Resource sharing for a deep learning aided multicarrier system,"Multicarrier modulation has been widely adopted in various wireless systems and a key technique for current and next generation mobile communication standards.  Various methods have been suggested for multicarrier systems for efficient resource sharing and to improve the performance of the system, but all those methods are at the cost of increased system complexity. In this context, this project suggests a novel end-to-end auto encoder based system implementation for multicarrier communication systems in the presence of fading channels.  The proposed system suggests deep neural network based modulation and demodulation blocks and directly feeds the decoder with channel state information and received signal, without any domain knowledge of a channel equalizer.  Such a fully data-driven system can effectively learn the encoder and decoder to maximize the diversity and coding gain in fading channels.  Under this project, the student has to build, train and run the proposed autoencoder based multicariersystem solely composed of deep neural networks and analyze the end-to-end performance of the proposed system under both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading environment."
4,A S Madhukumar,asmadhukumar@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0458,,Efficient compression of communication signals for geo-localization applications using deep convolutional autoencoders,"Localizing an RF emitter requires the transmission of enormous amounts of data from sensors to the processing centre. However, typically the available bandwidth for the data channels is extremely limited. Therefore, the usage of data compression methods is mandatory. Moreover, in the geo-localization applications, the sampled time domain data entails little or no temporal correlation, thus utilizing standard statistical transform methods challenging. 
In this project, time difference of arrival (TDOA) based geo-localization using synchronized receivers is considered. Since deep autoencoders are being used extensively to compress image, speech, biomedical signals, and also in various other signal processing applications, this work investigates deep learning methods to estimate the TDOA position directly from the raw compressed input data. The key idea is to use deep convolutional autoencoders to identify the efficient compressed latent representation of input data while retaining the estimation accuracy. Moreover, denoising autoencoders which work even with the noisy input data after it has been trained with clean datasets should also be studied. To evaluate the theoretical performance of proposed DL methods, Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) can be used as a benchmark. Finally, the trained network should also be tested using the real measurement data."
5,Anupam Chattopadhyay,anupam@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0021,,Protecting Neural Networks from Adversarial Attacks,"While a number of solutions for fast decisioning and inferencing on neural networks have been proposed in recent times, training a network remains a difficult task, often consuming days. The problem is likely to worsen due to data privacy, which mandates either the training to be done on an encrypted data-set, or to be done in a distributed manner with ¿whitening layer¿ added before integrating the multiple trained networks. The goal of this project is to set up a framework using OpenTPU and benchmarking the training time for various datasets. Subsequently, the training process needs to be optimised through batch-processing, hardware implementation, dynamic network tuning or a combination of the above.  "
6,Anupam Chattopadhyay,anupam@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0022,,Investigating Vulnerability of Watermarking Neural Network,"Data privacy is a major concern, which may result in significant loss of efficiency for neural networks - either due to having restricted data set or for the fact that privacy-preserving instruments need to be adopted during the training phase. A promising solution to the data privacy is using homomorphic encryption, which enables computing over encrypted data. However, these approaches suffer from high computation overhead. The goal of this project is to setup a flow for training phase using open-source libraries [1,2,3]. Subsequently, their portability and optimisations towards hardware platforms will be studied."
7,Anupam Chattopadhyay,anupam@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0024,,Machine Learning Accelerator Implementation on FPGA,"In this project, the objective is to study the existing machine learning paradigms. This has to be followed by a specific application domain selection. We are working on multiple such domains, including bioinformatics, financial technology, video analytics and electronic design automation. The student needs to select a specific type of Neural Network, show its efficiency over the other choices for the chosen application. Finally, this design needs to be ported on a multi-FPGA setup for scalability and efficiency in both training and inference."
9,Bo An,boan@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0093,,Designing Negotiation Agents for Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC),"ANAC is to steer the research in the area bilateral multi-issue closed negotiation. Closed negotiation, when opponents do not reveal their preferences to each other, is an important class of real-life negotiations.

10,Cai Wentong,aswtcai@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0491,,Creation of Meta-model for Agent-based Simulation Using Machine Learning Approach,"Agent based simulation is a technique with growing popularity in describing complex natural phenomena such as crowd and swarm behaviors.  An agent-based model is composed of autonomous and interacting agents whose behaviors are defined by simple rules.  While each agent may carry out very simple behaviors, the combined interaction of all agents can create rich emergent behaviors.  In each simulation time step, an agent autonomously performs the ¿sense-think-act"" cycle.  In the sense stage, the agent obtains information from the environment and other surrounding agents in its neighborhood.  In the think stage, the agent processes the obtained information.  Lastly, in the act stage, the agent modifies its own states and the environment based on the results of thinking. (You can look at the following page for examples of agent-based simulations: http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/#Screenshots)

Agent-based simulation may involve a large number of agents and have many parameters to calibrate.  Traditional optimization approaches often fail because they take way too long to complete the calibration process.  In this project, we will explore machine learning approaches to create meta models to speed-up the calibration process.  Using machine learning approach, it will be possible to capture the non-linear behavior and discontinuities in agent-based simulation.  And the metal model will run much faster than the full simulation model.  We will a rule-based agent-based simulation model as an example and train a neural net to replace the rules used in the agent-based model. "

15,Cham Tat Jen,astjcham@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0259,,Embodied Object Hunt,"Given an autonomous virtual agent with visual capability randomly spawned in a 3D virtual world and tasked to search for a particular object, how would the agent find this object? For example, if the object is a fork, the virtual agent's movement may be directed by sighting other objects that indicate a kitchen, e.g. a stove. This project will investigate using deep reinforcement learning to train the agent's behaviour purely from data, and represents a subset of the Embodied Question Answering problem."

This can be used to create panoramic images just from a normal photograph. This project will investigate the use of deep learning to create such a system."
17,Chen Change Loy,ccloy@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0205,,Long-Tailed Object Detection and Mask Segmentation,"The long-tailed distribution of real world data is still challenging for modern object detection and instance segmentation models. The imbalance issue often leads to a significant drop in accuracy especially for those tail classes with few training samples.

In this project, you will examine the effect of including weakly labelled data of long-tailed classes to the performance of deep learning based object detection and instance mask segmentation.

The student needs to have strong knowledge in computer vision or image processing, especially in the task of object detection and mask segmentation. Experience in Python programming and PyTorch is needed. Experience in working on Faster-RCNN or Mask R-CNN is a plus. "

Few shot learning is about learning from few examples. Usually deep neural networks need large amounts of training data for computer vision tasks such as classification and segmentation. However, in some domains, e.g. medical imaging, there may not be many examples of images to learn from. The question is how one can train a model to learn from few examples.

Usual methods to segment out the ship would not work because of the dynamic nature of the water surrounding it; the water is also considered as object due to its motion. Hence, a good water detection algorithm is required to isolate those regions in the video that could potentially contain a ship. The project inovlves development of an algorithm using computer vision techniques to detect water. The program can be developed in C++/Matlab."

Specifically, it answers the question of how an object can be used by an agent? In this project, we consider tools such as saw, shovel, scoop, knife etc. The shape of a tool is closely related to its affordance. We will use machine learning tools to learn the local shape and geometry primitives in order to detect the affordance of an object.

27,Douglas Leslie Maskell,asdouglas@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0358,,Approximate arithmetic for Energy-Efficient and Error-Tolerant Computing,"Approximate computing is considered as a potential alternative to accurate computing to achieve enhanced energy efficiency in portable and mobile electronic applications, which have a limited power budget and where the battery lifetime is an important concern. Approximate computing is being considered for practical digital signal processing applications such as image, video and audio processing where the results of approximate computing may not be distinguishable from the results of accurate computing. Within the realm of approximate computing, approximate computer arithmetic has received significant attention from the research community since the recent past. This project will deal with approximate addition and multiplication, which is an important facet of approximate computer arithmetic. Various approximate modules discussed in the literature will be studied to analyse their error range and characteristics.

28,Douglas Leslie Maskell,asdouglas@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0359,,VLSI-based Design of Priority Resolvers for Embedded Systems,"A N-input, N-output hardware priority resolver (encoder) serves as a polling device that permits access to a hardware resource whenever access requests initiated by multiple devices are received at its inputs, either on-chip or off-chip. Data buses, data comparators, incrementer-cum-decrementer modules, fixed-point and floating-point computation units and interconnection network routers are important embedded sub-systems which predominantly use the priority resolver function. In the existing literature, full-custom (i.e., transistor-level) design of priority resolvers are discussed and most of them are confined to a limited number of inputs. This project will consider a semi-custom VLSI-based implementation of priority resolvers for inputs of any size by utilizing a cascading architecture. ASIC and/or FPGA design environments would be considered for the physical implementation."
29,Douglas Leslie Maskell,asdouglas@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0360,,Design of New Majority Voters for N-Modular Redundant Systems used in Mission- and Safety-Critical Applications,"Mission-critical applications such as space, aerospace and defence systems, and safety-critical applications such as nuclear power plants, electric power transmission and distribution systems, industrial control and automation systems, and banking and financial systems usually employ N-modular redundancy (NMR) in their designs to incorporate a specific degree of fault tolerance to withstand arbitrary faults or failures of constituent circuits/systems when they might occur. In an NMR scheme, N systems are used and the correct operation of at least (N+1)/2 systems is necessary to guarantee the correct operation of an NMR configuration. The outputs of the N systems in an NMR configuration are majority voted, and this is achieved by using a majority voter. This project will study the majority voters in the existing literature and implement them in a VLSI-based design environment. Following this, the design of new majority voters for NMR systems based on Boolean majority theorems recently proposed in the literature will be considered. Subsequently, the new majority voters will be implemented and compared with the existing majority voters in terms of the design metrics. "
30,Erik Cambria,cambria@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0234,,Building SenticNet 7,"With the recent development of deep learning, research in AI has gained new vigor and prominence. While machine learning has succeeded in revitalizing many research fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis, we are yet to witness impressive progress in natural language understanding. One of the reasons behind this unmatched expectation is that, while a bottom-up approach is feasible for pattern recognition, reasoning and understanding often require a top-down approach. In this FYP, you will couple sub-symbolic and symbolic AI to automatically discover conceptual primitives from text and link them to commonsense concepts and named entities in a new three-level knowledge representation for sentiment analysis. In particular, you will employ recurrent neural networks to infer primitives by lexical substitution and use them for grounding common and commonsense knowledge by means of multi-dimensional scaling."

33,Jagath Chandana Rajapakse,asjagath@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0416,,Multilayer network representation of neuro-anatomically distinct genomic data in patients of psychiatric disorders,"Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression diminish individual potential, reduce quality of life and increase mortality. To address this gap in knowledge clinical researchers have increasingly looked at multiomics datasets of psychiatric patients complementarily to clinical data1.

Multivariate methods are well suited to large ¿omics¿ data sets where the number of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). 

In the proposed study final year students will analyse genomic data derived from anatomically distinct regions in the brain of psychiatric patients. The various levels of data, including diagnoses, brain region, genomic data and inflammation profile will be used to construct a multi-layered patient specific network3

Our proposal to implement novel techniques based on network based for integration of multi-omics data by using R and/or Python will equip the final year student in computational methods that enable clustering of patients into homogenous groups paving the way for the implementation of precision medicine."
34,Jagath Chandana Rajapakse,asjagath@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0417,,The discovery of novel biomarkers using multi-variate-based methods in Major Depressive disorder cohorts,"Psychiatric disorders diminish individual potential, reduce quality of life and  increase mortality. The etiology of major depressive disorder (MD) and the mechanism of drug response are not yet fully understood.  To address this gap in knowledge clinical researchers have increasingly looked at relating the biological profile of patients to their clinical outcomes thus leading to the field of biological and translational psychiatry1.

In   parallel, recent   advancements   of   omics   technologies   have   enabled   simultaneous measurement of many biological entities such as mRNA transcripts, proteins, and metabolites on a same set of biological samples. Yet, existing computational techniques primarily focus on single-layer molecular networks derived from one omics type and use simple strategies for integration. The aim of this project is to develop techniques to integrate multi-omics data of psychiatric patients using multivariate methods. 

Multivariate methods are well suited to large ¿omics data sets where the number of variables (e.g., genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). The final year student will learn multivariate statistical methods and methods of implementing them in data science development environments and relevant libraries such as mixomics in ¿R¿ and scikit Python.

35,Jagath Chandana Rajapakse,asjagath@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0437,,Building predictive models combining structural and functional connectome data via multi-view Graph Neural Networks,"The human connectome is measured via the structural connectome (SC) which comprises of white matter connections between brain regions, and the functional connectome (FC) which comprises  correlated activations across brain regions. The SC and FC are measured by Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) and functional MRI images of the brain. Interestingly, there has been converging evidence to support the hypothesis that the relationship between structure and function is heterogeneous: the coupling is stronger in primary sensory and motor regions but decouples over the course of neurodevelopment in regions that process multimodal inputs.

Both SC and FC can be modelled as graphs and both are known to vary across age and gender. Traditional machine learning and deep learning models have been successfully trained on these graphs to predict age and gender. However, models that incorporate both views for such predictions have not been proposed yet. Age and gender prediction are popular benchmarks as there are many known age effects and gender differences in both neurodevelopment, cognitive function and neurodegeneration. Thus, we will use it as a proxy before moving on to harder prediction goals such as cognitive and behavioural test scores. Drawing inspiration from Graph Neural Networks such as GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks, we will design novel graph neural network architectures that are able to fuse the two graphs such that the heterogeneous nature of structure-function coupling is captured, with the goal of improving prediction scores. The Human Connectome Project S1200 dataset will be the main dataset used for the experiments.

Throughout this project, the student will gain familiarity with deep learning frameworks such as Keras and PyTorch, especially the PyTorch Geometric library. Also, the student will develop an in-depth understanding of GCNs and the attention mechanism, as well as multiview deep learning."

Unfortunately, language specific
resources, features and annotations are costly to develop in new languages and new domains, making NER a challenge to adapt. Recently, neural architectures
for NER have been proposed  that use no language-specific resources or features. However, these methods require lots of labeled data to train an effective NER system, which may not be available for a new language or a domain. In this project our goal is to learn a cross-lingual neural NER model without any labeled data in the target domain."
39,Joty Shafiq Rayhan,srjoty@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0527,,Document-level Machine Translation with Local and Global Coherence Models,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become the dominant approach to machine translation (MT). They have become competitive with, or better than, the previous state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) systems, especially since the introduction of sequence-to-sequence models and the attention mechanism. Existing MT systems (both NMT and PBMT) work at the sentence level, i.e., they are trained to translate one sentence at a time. But, sentences in a text are not independent, rather they are related to form a coherent discourse. Each sentence follows smoothly from the previous ones and leads into the ones that come afterwards. In this project, our goal is to develop NMT models that can model inter-sentence relations in a text while translating texts from a source language (Chinese) to a target language (English).

Such traits pose significant challenges for effective point cloud processing and analysis using either conventional methods or convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models. Existing work transforms a point cloud into a more regular volume representation before applying 3D CNN or processes it using 2D CNN by converting it into a collection of multi-view images. However, these approaches are either computationally intensive or likely to lose important features of the original point cloud. Alternatively, a point cloud can be parameterized into the 2D domain and represented as a regular geometry image by mapping the coordinates (x, y, z) of points to the values (r, g, b) of pixels. To make full use of the substantial investment of 2D CNN, this project will develop new geometry-image representation schemes using deep learning and explore the use of the obtained geometry images in downstream tasks such as point cloud segmentation, classification, compression, etc.

To sufficiently represent a 3D object or scene, it can be made up of millions or even billions of points, each of which is associated with the geometric information and possible attributes, resulting in a huge volume of data. Compression has thus become a necessity for many practical 3D-related applications. Due to the irregular and unordered nature of point clouds, effective compression of such data is usually a non-trivial task and the performance of existing codecs based on traditional coding methodologies is still far from being satisfactory. During recent years, deep learning-based approaches have shown remarkable performance in image and video compression. However, they generally cannot be directly applied to point clouds because of the difference in dimensionality and data structure. To address this, this project will explore a new latent representation of point cloud based on deep convolution autoencoder and develop an end-to-end compression framework for effective point cloud geometry coding.

Nevertheless, the performance of such communication backbone is limited by two issues. The hop-by-hop transmission results in time-consuming long-distance communication, especially when the network size grows. The network contention among communication pairs with shared links results in huge delay and drastically degrades the NoC performance, especially when the communication volume increases. To eliminate or decrease the latency caused by long-distance and contention, a novel NoC architecture that controls the action of each router and performs global optimization using softare approach should be proposed. Such a software-controlled NoC customizes the NoC intercommunication architecture to adapt to the application and maximize the total system performance. The objective of this project is to implement an NoC architecture which consists of reconfigurable routers together with a centralized controller to replace per-router arbitration.

These two techniques enable the adversary to inject adversarial samples in a minimal set of critical moments while causing the most severe damage to the agent. In the first technique, the adversary builds a model to predict the future environmental states and agent's actions, assesses the damage of each possible attack strategy, and select the optimal one. In the second technique, the adversary automatically learns a domain-agnostic model to discover the critical moments of attacking the agent in an episode. This work evaluates the performance of attack techniques in terms of attack steps. Our goal is to analyze the robustness of DRL agents by establishing stealthy and efficient attack strategies."

However, the internal knowledge of the model is difficult to interpret, which hinders the visualization, analysis, and reliability of the model. In this project, we will explore how to use knowledge graphs to represent knowledge in deep learning models so that humans can easily evaluate the model according to the correctness of the acquired knowledge. What's more attractive is that when the model is used for downstream tasks such as image classification, it can generate its prediction and attach a knowledge graph to describe the reason behind the answer for human reference. For example, with a picture of a car, we expect that when the model makes a correct prediction, it also provides a small knowledge graph with components like ¿grassland --beside--> road --under--> wheels --under--> car body <--in-- human¿, which will enhance the reliability of the model."

The basic idea is to regress SMPL parameters, which include parameters that control body shape and pose, from point clouds inputs. The topic have not yet been fully studied by the literature, which means chances and challenges both exists in this exciting project."

Conventionally, being aware of all these aspects require a very diversified types of sensors, for example, electrocardiogram (ECG) for heat beat measurements and video analysis for gait recognition.

Recently, there is a trend of unifying all these sensing task into a single sensor based on Radio-Frequency (RF, e.g., WiFi), driven by the last development of signal processing and deep learning techniques. In particular, special type of RF sensors are developed main for such integrated tasks, which will be used by our project.

In this project, we intend to explore these newly available RF sensors. Essentially, we first need to gather a large amount of sensing data on human physical status, ranging from gesture/behavior to vital signs. Then we develop deep learning modules and train them to recognize various human physical statuses out of seemingly wild RF signals. If time allows and if we get a big team on this project, we could also extend the objective to sentimental analysis based on RF sensing.

In this project, you are supposed to use the most up-to-date RF sensors: we collect sensing data first and then we apply standard deep data analytics upon these data. So you are required to understand the basic concept of RF, and some basic knowledge of machine learning/data analytics would be a plus.

However, with increasingly complex model architecture, large latency during model transfer can be induced and model training can take up a lot of time. Therefore, to solve this, we would like to suggest adaptations to the conventional federated learning process. In this project, students will research on different adaptation techniques to the conventional federated learning. This can include deep reinforcement learning for model pruning to reduce the complex model's size."

They provide new ways for design, which the designer is familiar with. This project aims to investigate novel modelling techniques using AI algorithms. In particular, evolution algorithms mimic the biological evolution in nature and exhibit stochastic characteristics intrinsically. "

To become proficient in the art of tongue diagnosis, the practitioner must be able to recognize and identify the pathological characteristics of the tongue as it relates to disease. 

This project aims to use advanced media technology to make the process of tongue diagnosis digital and automatic. In particular, we investigate image processing algorithms for analyzing pictures of tongues and develop new methods for comparing an input picture of tongue with the pictures stored in the database, by which the diagnosis can be done automatically or by user himself.

To provide excellent rendering effects in real time, it is often required that the models should be simplified. This FYP project aims to implement and develop efficient algorithms to simplify 3D triangular mesh models with textures. Such models are common in various graphics applications. Particularly, we will explore how to incorporate human perception about shapes into the process. While human perception of quality is difficult to quantify, we are interested in building a computational model for visual quality metric and examining the effectiveness of visual quality metrics in the context of level-of-detail (LOD) generation. The project requires the student to have passion in 3D graphics and good programming skills."

However, if it is an automated system that will have to follow this path, it may have its own interests in its quality. As a result, such automated system may resort to suggestions to human controllers regarding the path to be taken. In this project, we will study how different visual path cues effect (if at all) the degree of advice acceptance."

Many of them try to adapt to dynamic preferences of their users, some only allow the user to modify their behaviour or advice preferences. Neither is very successful. In this project, we will try to take another look into why that happens. The conjecture is that the acceptance of advice is changing over time. The project will create a controlled advice environment (in a game form) that will allow to test whether and how the acceptance of automated advice changes over time, whether it depends on performance only or the length of interaction itself, which of these parameters is prevalent. The project can concentrate on the creating the environment only (more programming) and expand into a more research oriented variant (studying behaviour models, comparing their performance, etc.)"

164,Zinovi Rabinovich,zinovi@ntu.edu.sg,SCSE21-0392,,Non-point attitudes in understanding contextual human preference data,"When people choose and rate products they are subject to context of when, how and why such decisions are made. For example, being in a good mood one may choose to watch a comedy and rate it highly. But if the same person will be forced to watch the same move in a bad or sad mood, some jokes may seem distasteful and the movie will be rated low. In this project, we will try to identify and model hidden context in such rating data. Both using specialised data sets, and commonly used recommender system data blocks (like that of MovieLens), we seek to apply Deep Learning methods to demonstrate the possibility to identify, recover and exploit implicit context."
